        <br>
        <h3 class="the">We should save them because:</h3>
        <ul class="the"><li>Everything material in our culture ultimately comes from natural resources.</li>
        <li>For example, Coal, Oil, Soil, Water, Land, Minerals, Forests and Timber, and Air we breathe.</li>
        <li>The role natural resources has on earth is imperative indeed.</li>
        <li>That is why itâ€™s so important for us to all have some accountability and why we need to PROTECT and RESPECT our environment.</li></ul>
